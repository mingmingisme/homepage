## About Me

Shuming ZHANG （张书鸣）, currently a **Master Candidate** of Computer Science 
and Technology advised by Prof. Yan Qiang, is with **[College of Computer 
Science and Technology (Data Science)](https://ccst.tyut.edu.cn/), [Taiyuan 
University of Technology](https://english.tyut.edu.cn/)**. 

I was recommended to study a Master's degree without entrance examination at 
the senior year (2021-2022) of my undergraduate. Now my **research intersts** 
are in medical image processing, deep learning, etc.

  **Unpaired low-dose computed tomography image denoising using a progressive 
  cyclical convolutional neural network**

  *Qing Li, Runrui Li, Saize Li, Tao Wang, Yubin Cheng, **Shuming Zhang**, 
  et al.*

  **[Published Feb 25 2023]**

  **Abstract**: Background 
  Reducing the radiation dose from computed tomography (CT) can significantly 
  reduce the radiation risk to patients. However, low-dose CT (LDCT) suffers 
  from severe and complex noise interference that affects subsequent 
  diagnosis and analysis. Recently, deep learning-based methods have shown 
  superior performance in LDCT image-denoising tasks. However, most methods 
  ...

  **PMSG-Net: A priori-guided multilevel graph transformer fusion network for 
  immunotherapy efficacy prediction**

  *Wanting Yang, Wei Wu, Long Wang, **Shuming Zhang**, Juanjuan Zhao, Yan 
  Qiang*

  **[Published Sept 2023]**

  **Abstract**: In the case of specific immunotherapy regimens and access to 
  pre-treatment CT scans, developing reliable, interpretable intelligent image 
  biomarkers to predict efficacy is essential for physician decision-making 
  and patient treatment selection. However, varying levels of prognosis show a 
  similar appearance on CT scans. It becomes challenging to stratify patients
